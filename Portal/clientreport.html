            <h2>Client Report</h2>
            <p>
                The content I used for the content and images was wholly AI generated. I decided 
                I wanted a site to sell the Thneed from the Lorax book, except I wanted it to
                look like it was the Apple store. I was in contact with my developer for the first
                part of development but mostly I let him do his own things after that. I didn't have
                very strict requirements for what I wanted so I trusted him to do a decent job, and he
                did. I like how it turned out. The team was able to fairly interpret the wireframe I
                gave them and it came out looking better than I expected. If I even hire another team to
                do this sort of thing, I'll be sure to give them a much more detailed wireframe for every
                page since I drew mine in the space of 10 minutes based on an idea I had in my head. It will
                be easier to make if it's more defined, I'm sure.
            </p>
            <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
            <p>
                I talked with one of my junior developers because he sat nearby. I put some notes in the readme
                to help guide the loose instructions we were given by the client. The client forgot to make
                other wireframes, so he asked that we make the other pages using content he already requested
                for the main page. I could have done a better job communicating this plan to my junior developers.
                That said, my juniors were very willing to help, and I'm grateful. I communicated with the client
                primarily through microsoft teams and talking in person. I sent him the link to the page so that he
                could see how it was progressing. GitHub was fairly simple after I understood it, just tricky to 
                get started with. No issues with files getting messed up, so that's great.
            </p>
            <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
            <p>
                Ethan spoke to me directly at the beginning of the project to make sure everything was set up and
                explain a bit of the plan. The only problem was he didn't tell me or my fello junior developer, Eric,
                which pages we should do. We coordinated together outside of class so that both got done. That site
                turned out pretty good, I think. It looked like the wireframe at least.<br>
                I had no contact with James. Perhaps I should have done more to get in touch, but it didn't
                seem like he was working on the site either. It's still just a blank page that says "Test". I wasn't
                able to work on the site because I didn't have any idea what the site was. No wireframe or concept.<br>
                No issues with GitHub in either project.
            </p>
            <h2>General Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                It was tough thinking about three projects at the same time. I wasn't used to managing that many
                distinct things, even if they were mostly small. In the end I was able to get my main page done
                and the subpage for Ethan wasn't too bad either. I just needed to focus on one at a time.<br>
                I enjoyed the freedom of making a website. I had a hard time learning html and css this semester because
                more often than not I would learn something and, because I didn't use it much outside of class, I would forget it.
                In this project however, I was able to warm back up to the basics and it was fun solving
                problems to make everything look how I wanted it to.<br>
                If I were to do this project again, I would try to get to know my fellow developers sooner,
                with clear expectations for communication. I waited too long to contact everyone and that
                turned out poorly.<br>
                I feel more capable of making a website now than I was at the start of the semester, that's for sure.
                I see how a lot of the principles we learned can be applied to make whatever I want using html and css.
                I'm sure it will only get more expansive next semester when I lear dynamic web development.
